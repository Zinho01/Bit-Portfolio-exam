# üí¨ Yapchat

Yapchat is a mobile app with which users can converse with eachother in one large chatroom without needing to log in or fill in their phone number.

## üìñ Description

Yapchat was developed during a one-week 'Deep Dive' project at Bit Academy, where students had four days to collaboratively build an application. The focus of this Deep Dive was on creating Progressive Web Applications.

### Features

YapChat features a large chatroom where everyone that is currently using the app can communicate with eachother. You fill in a display name before you start, so there is no need for creating an account, or filling in a phone number.

It can be difficult to communicate with someone when there are a lot of people using the chatroom. This is why you can reply to a specific message by simply tapping it and writing a response.
