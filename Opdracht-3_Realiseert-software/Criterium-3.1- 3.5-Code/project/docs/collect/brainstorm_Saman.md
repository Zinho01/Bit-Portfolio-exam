Implement a feature where the Pokédex plays dynamic background music based on the generation of the selected Pokémon. For example, if the user selects a first-generation Pokémon, the app plays music from the original Pokémon Red and Blue games.

Enhance the Pokédex with information on the strengths and weaknesses of each Pokémon based on their type. Trainers can easily access this data to make strategic decisions during battles. Additionally, include a comprehensive type chart for quick reference.


#### Idea 4: Team Building Tool

Create a team-building feature within the Pokédex website. Trainers can assemble and save their Pokémon teams. This tool enhances the planning aspect of Pokémon training, allowing users to organize and visualize their teams for battles or competitions.

#### Idea 5: "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button

Introduce an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button within the Pokédex that, when clicked, takes the trainer to a random Pokémon entry. This feature allows trainers to discover new Pokémon and learn about species they might not have encountered before.

#### Idea 6: Diverse Sorting Methods

Enhance the usability of the main page by incorporating different sorting methods. Trainers can customize the display order of Pokémon entries based on criteria such as alphabetical order, and numerical Pokédex entry, amongst other sorting methods. This makes the easier easier to navigate
