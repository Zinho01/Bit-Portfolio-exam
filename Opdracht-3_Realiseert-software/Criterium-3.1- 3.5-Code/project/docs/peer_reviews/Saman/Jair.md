# Feedback for Jair

## What did you think of the overall collaboration with Nathan?
Unfortunately, Jair couldn't help much as he was sick for a day, and also doesn't know much about Pokemon. But he did do his best and helped with styling the page. His efforts were appreciated and he contributed to the project to the best of his abilities given the circumstances.
